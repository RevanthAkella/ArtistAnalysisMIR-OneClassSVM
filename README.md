# ArtistAnalysisMIR-OneClassSVM
This project is an analysis of KanyeWest's music using a OneClass SVM to understand how his music 
changed with each album and plot a contour plot of the entropy of his tracks. 

This can show how different tracks can be related to/derived from each other or how their sound was 
possibly derived from a similar idea. The project was performed by my teammates David Huang and Zan Javed, and me.

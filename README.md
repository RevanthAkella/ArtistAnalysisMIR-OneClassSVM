# ArtistAnalysisMIR-OneClassSVM
This project is an analysis of KanyeWest's music using a OneClass SVM to understand how his music 
changed with each album and plot a contour plot of the entropy of his tracks. 

This can show how different tracks can be related to/derived from each other or how their sound was 
possibly derived from a similar idea. The project was performed by my teammates David Huang and Zan Javed, and me.

The API used here is the Spotify API for developers that allows us to extract music data from spotify and perform analyses on the data. The scraper file is essential to creating a CSV of the artis's songs and audio features of the songs.
